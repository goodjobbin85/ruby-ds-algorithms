This repository is a set of data structure and algorithm problems and 
their solutions, meant to be of use in preparation for software engineering technical interviews. Ruby is the preferred language. Some problems will have corresponding blog posts and Youtube videos, and if this is the case, links will be provided in the comments of the file. Additional links to resources that the author found useful will be provided in the comments as well. Happy coding!
